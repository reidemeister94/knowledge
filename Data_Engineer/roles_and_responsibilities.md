## Roles and Responsibilities

Regardless of the domain theyâ€™re working in (finance, social media, etc.), data engineers have common responsibilities that combine the knowledge and skills of information technology, engineering, and databases.

- Data Pipeline Testing/ Maintenance: Data engineers test the performance and efficiency of each part of a system or model during the initial phase. Moreover, they collaborate with the testing team to make sure everything is running smoothly.

- Designing Data Platform Architecture: At its core, data engineers have to design the architecture of a data platform, from the implementation of a fact table to the various dimension tables that inform it.

- Provide Data-Access Tools: In the majority of cases, data-access tools are not needed, as data scientists can use data lakes to fetch or extract data from storage. But if the enterprise requires business intelligence (BI) for analysts and other users, data engineers set up the tools to create visuals, observe data, and generate reports.

- Development of Data Instances: Data engineers use their coding skills to build, customize, and overlook integration tools, warehouses, databases, and analytical systems.

- Handle Data and Metadata: Data is stored in a warehouse in a structured or unstructured manner. However, storage systems may also contain meta-data. A data engineer is responsible for managing all the data stored in the warehouse. Moreover, they have to structure it precisely through database management systems (DBMS).

- Monitoring the Stability of Pipelines: Managing the entire performance, efficiency, and stability of the system is essential while the warehouse is being cleaned after equal time intervals. The automated parts of the system also need to be tracked and upgraded according to the data and requirements.
