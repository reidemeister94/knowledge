## Soft Skills
As with any type of job interview, hiring managers will also typically want to assess whether you are a good culture fit, work well with others, and can deal productively with things like failure. They may also want to assess your relevant past experience and quiz you on your familiarity with various tools and architectures. Here are some of the behavioral data engineer interview questions you can expect on your interview:

- Q15. What Big Data tools do you use and for what tasks?

- Q16. What is your experience using cloud technologies?

- Q17. Share some details or insights about projects where you've used huge datasets. What was your approach in solving the data problem?

- Q18. When would you use Java instead of Python?

- Q19. How would you design a data warehouse given X criteria?

- Q20. How would you design a data pipeline?

- Q21. What is the architecture of Spark?

- Q22. What is a challenge you've faced handling big data for a company?

- Q23. Tell me about a situation where you dealt with a technology that you weren't familiar with.
